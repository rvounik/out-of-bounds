# out of bounds

just another game engine

this time I wanted to see if I could recreate one of those classic golf games of the early nineties (pga tour golf) but using a pseudo-3d projection. as usual once the engine is finished I cant be bothered finishing it to a
playable state, so right now you can not finish this game in any way.

run it from your local web server:
 
php -S 127.0.0.1:9009

or open index.html in your browser (only tested in Chrome)

features:

- title screen
- option screen
- psseudo-3d projection
- player rotation
- side panels that can be hidden
- club selection
- a very crude ball trajectory that is far from finished
- music, sound effects
